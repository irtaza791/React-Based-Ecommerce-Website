Overview of approach

The journey to create the Elite Equine Solution platform was an interesting one, which started with identifying the challenges faced by the online shopping community. A simple question was asked - what problems were online shoppers and website administrators experiencing? Once the pain points were understood, the goals and plan for the project were outlined more effectively.
The technology chosen to bring this project to life had to meet criteria of being robust, flexible, and efficient. So, React, a powerful JavaScript library, was decided for the front-end development. The beauty of React lies in its component-based architecture, which allowed for building the platform in a modular way, making it easier to develop and integrate various features like price tracking and order tracking and many more.
For the backend, Firebase was chosen which offers a multitude of tools including data storage, real-time updates and secure user authentication system everything under one platform. Firebase made the development process smoother and simplified the management and monitoring of the platform.
